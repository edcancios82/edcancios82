### Hi there! 😁

My name is Emmanuel Duda (🇧🇷). I've been working as Developer since 2006 and currently I'm CEO at [FastFeedback Systems]. I'm passionate about front end development.

In my free time I like to play (and watch) soccer (⚽️), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and eventually I like to philosophize about life with a beer (🍺).

Would you like to find me?
